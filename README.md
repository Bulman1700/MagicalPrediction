#MagicalPrediction

This is a programming assignment that I enjoyed doing that uses the Trie data structure to predict the next letter of an unfinished word. Letters have a integer frequency associated with them. Letters with the highest frequency are chosen to be the predicted next letter.

This program writes to an out.txt file with the required output.

MagicalPrediction is a name I came up with to keep the assignment confidential. There were no required functions (other than using the Trie data strucuture), and I had total control of how the program worked as long as it produced the correct output. I also included a printTrie() function that was not a part of the assignment, but just as a backtracking exersize.
